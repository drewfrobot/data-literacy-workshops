# data-literacy-workshops
A series of short lessons on particular strategies and techniques when working with data.

There are two main lessons

1.  Wide versus Narrow Data formats. There are Jupyter notebooks for Python and R, and an R Notebook also for running in RStudio.
2.  XML and JSON Data Formats. There is an R Notebook for RStudio using the visNetwork visualisation library, and there is a Jupyter notebook version using R and the igraph visualisation library. Unfortunately the visNetwork library doesn't work in Jupyter notebooks (yet!)

The R Notebooks can be run in RStudio. The Jupyter notebooks can be run in local Jupyter installations, or purely in a browser using Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true). To use Google Colab, sign in to a gmail account first then head along to Google Colab, select Github and drewfrobot and the Jupyter Notebooks can be selected. There is an additional code line to execute when used in Colab to install the R libraries needed.

Have Fun!
